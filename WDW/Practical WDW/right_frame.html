          The Jagadguru Veerasimhaasana Peetha was established in the 11th
          Century A.D. at Sutturu by Adi Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeshwara
          Shivayogi Mahaswamiji. Sutturu is a village in Nanjangud taluk, Mysuru
          District in Karnataka. It is about 28 km from Mysuru city, in the
          south east direction. The Peetha with its high ideals has been making
          remarkable contribution in religious, social, educational and economic
          spheres in the state and across the country. It is striving for social
          development by responding to the community needs. It strongly believes
          that, unless the problems of the socially backward communities and the
          poor are taken care, there will not be social development. With this
          objective, the math has initiated several programmes, while at the
          same time living up to its principle of “work is worship” and is
          engaged in raising public awareness on issues of social concern.
